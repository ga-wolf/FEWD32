// The Fortune Teller

// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var numChildren = 100;
var partnerName = "Bill Murray";
var geoLocation = "The Ghetto";
var jobTitle = "Ping pong player";

var fortune =
  "You will be a " +

  " in " +

  ", and married to " +
  partnerName +
  " with " +
  numChildren +
  " kids.";
